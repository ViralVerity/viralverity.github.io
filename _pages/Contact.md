Please get in touch with me however you like, although email is most likely to be answered.

I'm happy to talk to journalists, and I've done radio, podcast and newspaper interviews in the past.

I love talking about my research to new people (and also the sound of my own voice) so please invite me to give talks on any of my [research themes](https://viralverity.github.io/_pages/Research) (please, I want to see more of the US)
