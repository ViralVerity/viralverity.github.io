intro: 
  - excerpt: "Hi! I'm Verity and I'm a genomic epidemiologist, phylogeneticist and evolutionary biologist, with a focus on RNA viruses of public health importance.
<br><br>
 I currently work as a postdoctoral research associate in [Nate Grubaugh's lab](https://grubaughlab.com/) at the Yale School of Public Health on arboviruses, but particularly Dengue. I've also worked on the SARS-CoV-2 response in the UK, and developed a (massively overcomplicated) agent based model for Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.
<br><br>
To see where I've been and what I do, take a look at my [CV](https://viralverity.github.io/_pages/CV) and [selected publications](https://viralverity.github.io/_pages/Publications)
<br><br>
If you're looking to collaborate, or a journalist looking to chat about virus evolution and how it impacts public health, [get in touch!](https://viralverity.github.io/_pages/Contact)"
